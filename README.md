# Object Oriented Programming

## What is OOP?

Object oriented programming is a method of creating **objects**, which can hold **data** and **methods (functions)** that work on that data.

## Advantages of OOP

- OOP provides a clear structure to programs
- Makes code easier to maintain, reuse, and debug
- Helps keep the code DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself)
- Makes it possible to create full reusable applications with less code and shorter development time

## Class

<details>
<summary>View contents</summary>

**Class:** - A blueprint for objects. A class defines what an object should look like, and an object is created based on that class.

### Instance

**Instance:** - Objects that are constructed from a class blueprint that contain their class's methods and properties.

**Instantiating:** Creating an object that is an instance of a class is called instantiating a class.

### Create a Class

**In Python:**

```py

# vehicle.py
# _name - private variable or private property or method
# __name -

class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, make, model, year):
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year

car = Vehicle('Audi', '45d', 2018)

```

`Classes in Python can have a special __init__ method, which gets called every time you create an instance of the class (instantiate). The self keyword refers to the current class instance.`

**In Javascript:**

```js
class Vehicle {
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make;
    this.model = model;
    this.year = year;
  }
}

car = new Vehicle("Audi", "45d", 2018);
```

## 4 fundamental concepts of OOP

1. Abstraction
2. Encapsulation
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

## 1. Abstraction

<details>
<summary>View contents</summary>

**Abstraction:** - Abstraction captures the essential attributes and behavior based on the context, while ignores the irrelevant information.

For example, the essential attributes and behavior for a student from the perspective of academic:

Attributes: (Course Name, Grade, Student ID, etc.)
Behavior: (Studying, Doing Assignments, Attending Lectures, etc.)

But the hobby of a student or the favorite sports of a student is not important here.

</details>

## 2. Encapsulation

<details>
<summary>View contents</summary>

**Encapsulation** - Encapsulation means a sort capsule that contains something inside, some of which can be accessed from outside and some of which cannot. In programming, encapsulation means the practice of keeping fields within a class private, then providing access to those fields via public methods (e.g. getter and setter methods).

**Example:**

- Let designing a Deck class, we make cards a private attribute (a list)
- The length of the cards should be accessed via a public method called count() --i.e. Deck.count()

</details>

## 3. Inheritance

<details>
<summary>View contents</summary>

**Inheritance:** A key feature of OOP is the ability to define a class which inherits from another class (a "base" or "parent" class).

**Example:**

**In Python:**

```py
class User:
    active_users = 0

    def __init__(self, first_name: str, last_name: str, age: int = 18):
        self._first_name = first_name  # instance variable
        self._last_name = last_name  # instance variable
        self.__age = age

    def __repr__(self):
        return f"{self._first_name} is {self.__age}."

    # def __str__(self):
    #     return f"{self._first_name} is {self.__age}."

    @property
    def full_name(self):
        return f"{self._first_name} {self._last_name}"

    @full_name.setter
    def full_name(self, name):
        self._first_name, self._last_name = name.split(' ')

    @classmethod
    def display_active_users(cls):
        return f"There are currently {cls.active_users} active users"

    def description(self):
        return f"{self._first_name} is a general user."

    def birthday(self):
        self.__age += 1
        return f"Happy {self.__age}th, {self._first_name}"

    def login(self):
        User.active_users += 1

    def logout(self):
        User.active_users -= 1
        return f"{self._first_name} has logged out"


class Moderator(User):
    def __init__(self, first_name, last_name, community):
        super().__init__(first_name, last_name)
        self.__community = community

    # override method
    def description(self):
        return f"{self._first_name} is a moderator."

    def remove_post(self):
        return f"{self.full_name} removed a post from the {self.__community} community"


generalUser = User('Foyez', 'Ahmed')
moderator = Moderator('Sohel', 'Mahmud', 'cricket')

print(generalUser)

print(generalUser.__dict__)
print(moderator.__dict__)
print()

print(generalUser.full_name)

generalUser.full_name = 'Manam Ahmed'
print(generalUser.full_name)
print()

print(generalUser.description())
print(moderator.description())
print()

generalUser.login()
print(User.display_active_users())

print(moderator.remove_post())
```

**In Javascript:**

```js
// Class syntax or syntactical sugar
// myPerson --> Person.prototype --> Object.prototype --> null

const activeUsers = Symbol("activeUsers");

class User {
  constructor(firstName, lastName, age = 18) {
    User[activeUsers] = 0;
    this._firstName = firstName; // instance variable
    this._lastName = lastName;
    this._age = age;
  }

  get fullName() {
    return `${this._firstName} ${this._lastName}`;
  }

  set fullName(name) {
    [this._firstName, this._lastName] = name.split(" ");
  }

  static display_active_users() {
    return `There are currently ${User[activeUsers]} active users`;
  }

  description() {
    return `${this._firstName} is a general user.`;
  }

  birthday() {
    this._age += 1;
    return `Happy ${this._age}th, ${this._firstName}`;
  }

  login() {
    User[activeUsers] += 1;
  }

  logout() {
    User[activeUsers] -= 1;
    return `${this._firstName} has logged out`;
  }
}

class Moderator extends User {
  // js isn't strict about arity
  constructor(firstName, community) {
    super(firstName);
    this._community = community;
  }

  // override method
  description() {
    return `${this._firstName} is a moderator.`;
  }

  remove_post() {
    return `${this.fullName} removed a post from the ${this._community} community`;
  }
}

generalUser = new User("Foyez", "Ahmed", 20);
moderator = new Moderator("Sohel", "cricket");

console.log(generalUser.fullName);

generalUser.fullName = "Manam Ahmed";
console.log(generalUser.fullName);
console.log();

console.log(generalUser.description());
console.log(moderator.description());
console.log();

console.log(generalUser.birthday());
console.log(moderator.birthday());
console.log();

generalUser.login();
console.log(User.display_active_users());

console.log(moderator.remove_post());
```

## 4. Polymorphism

<details>
<summary>View contents</summary>

**Polymorphism:** The ability of an object to have different or many (poly) forms (morph) depending on the context.

**Example 1: The same class method works in a similar way for different classes**

```py
Cat.speak() # meow
Dog.speak() # woof
Human.speak() # yo
```

At a high level the `speak()` method doing the same thing, but at a low level the implementation of the method is totally different.

**Example 2: The operation works for different kinds of objects**

```py
sample_list = [1, 2, 3]
sample_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
sample_string = 'awesome'

len(sample_list)
len(sample_tuple)
len(sample_string)
```

## Polymorphism & Inheritance

**1. The same class method works in a similar way for different classes**
A common implementation of this is to have a method in a base (or parent) class that is overriden by a subclass. This is called method **overridening**.
The same class method means that it have the same method signature (same name, same arguments & same return types).

- Each subclass will have a different implementation of the method.
- If the method is not implemented in the subclass, the version in the parent class is called instead.

```py
class Animal():
  def speak(self):
    raise NotImplementedError('Subclass needs to implement this method')

class Dog(Animal):
  def speak(self):
    return 'woof'

class Cat(Animal):
  def speak(self):
    return 'meow'

class Fish(Animal):
  pass

d = Dog()
print(d.speak())

f = Fish()
print(f.speak())
```

**2. (Polymorphism) The same operation works for different kinds of objects**

```py
8 + 2 # 10
'8' + '2' # 82
```

## OOP CONCEPTS RECAP

<details>
<summary>View contents</summary>

### 1. Encapsulation

**Definition:**
Wrapping data (attributes) and methods (behavior) into a single unit (class), while restricting direct access to the data.

- Keep attributes private via private/protected fields
- Access/modify them via public getters/setters for controlled access

```ts
class BankAccount {
  private balance: number = 0; // hidden (cannot access directly)

  // modify via public setter
  deposit(amount: number): void {
    this.balance += amount;
  }

  // access via public getter
  getBalance(): number {
    return this.balance;
  }
}
```

**Real-Life Example:**

- A bank account → you can deposit/withdraw, but you cannot directly open the bank’s database and change your balance.
- Access is controlled through an interface (ATM / banking app).

### 2. Abstraction

**Definition:**
Showing only essential features, hiding the implementation details.

- Hide implementation details, expose essential features
- Achieved via abstract classes / methods

```ts
abstract class Vehicle {
  abstract startEngine(): void; // "what", not "how"
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  startEngine(): void {
    console.log("Key ignition start!");
  }
}

class Bike extends Vehicle {
  startEngine(): void {
    console.log("Kick-start!");
  }
}
```

**Real-Life Example:**

- Car driver → presses “start” button or turns a key, without knowing how the ignition system, spark plugs, or fuel injection work.
- Only essential action exposed: “start the engine”.

### 3. Inheritance

**Definition:**
One class acquires the properties and methods of another class.

- reuse properties & behaviors of a base (parent) class
- Derived (child) classes extend functionality

```ts
class Vehicle {
  drive(): void {
    console.log("Vehicle moves");
  }
}

class Car extends Vehicle {
  openTrunk(): void {
    console.log("Trunk opened");
  }
}

const car = new Car();
car.drive();
car.openTrunk();
```

**Real-Life Example:**

- Parent → Child relationship.
- A smartphone inherits from a phone (it can call like a normal phone, but also has extra features like camera, apps, internet).

### 4. Polymorphism

Definition:
Performing the same action in different ways (many forms).

- Method overriding
- Same interface, different implementations

```ts
class Animal {
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("Some sound");
  }
}

class Dog extends Animal {
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("Woof!");
  }
}

class Cat extends Animal {
  makeSound(): void {
    console.log("Meow!");
  }
}

function playSound(animal: Animal) {
  animal.makeSound();
}
```

**Real-Life Example:**

- Remote control button → the same “power” button turns on the TV, AC, or Projector, but each device reacts differently.
- One action (press button), many forms (different responses).

### 5. Constructors & Destructors

Definition:

- Constructor: special method called when an object is created (initializes state).
- Destructor: special method called when an object is destroyed (cleanup) – explicit in C++ but automatic (GC) in TypeScript/Java.

```ts
class File {
  constructor(private name: string) {
    console.log(`${name} opened`);
  }

  close(): void {
    console.log(`${this.name} closed`);
  }
}

const file = new File("data.txt");
file.close(); // manual "destruction"
```

**Real-Life Example:**

- Hotel check-in and check-out.
  - Constructor = when you check in, your room is prepared.
  - Destructor = when you check out, the room is cleaned and reset.
