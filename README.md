# Object Oriented Programming

## What is OOP?
Object oriented programming is a method of programming that attempts to model some process or thing in the world as a **class** or **object**.

### Class
**Class:** - A blueprint for objects. Classes can contain methods (functions) and attributes (simmilar to keys in a dict).

### Instance
**Instance:** - Objects that are constructed from a class blueprint that contain their class's methods and properties.

**Instantiating:** Creating an object that is an instance of a class is called instantiating a class.

#### Creating a Class

```py
# vehicle.py
# _name - private variable or private property or method
# __name - 

class Vehicle:
  def __init__(self, make, model, year):
    self.make = make
    self.model = model
    self.year = year

car = Vehicle('Audi', '45d', 2018)
```
`Classes in Python can have a special __init__ method, which gets called every time you create an instance of the class (instantiate). The self keyword refers to the current class instance.`

```js
class Vehicle {
  constructor(make, model, year) {
    this.make = make
    this.model = model
    this.year = year
  }
}

car = new Vehicle('Audi', '45d', 2018)
```

## Why OOP?
With object oriented programming, the goal is to *encapsulate* your code into **logical, hierarchical groupings using classes** so that you can reason about your code at higher level.

## 4 fundamental concepts of OOP
1. Encapsulation
2. Abstraction
3. Inheritance
4. Polymorphism

## 1. Encapsulation
**Encapsulation** - the grouping of public and private attributes and methods into a programmatic class, making abstraction possible.

**Example:** 
* Let designing a Deck class, we make cards a private attribute (a list)
* The length of the cards should be accessed via a public method called count() --i.e. Deck.count()

## 2. Abstraction
**Abstraction:** - Exposing only "relevant" data in a class interface, hiding private attributes and methods (aka the "inner workings") from users.

## 3. Inheritance
**Inheritance:** A key feature of OOP is the ability to define a class which inherits from another class (a "base" or "parent" class).

**Example:**

```py
class User:
  active_users = 0

  def __init__(self, first, last, age):
    self.first = first
    self.last = last
    self.age = max([age, 0])
    self._secret = 'hi'
    self.__msg = 'I like turtles!'
    User.active_users += 1

  def __repr__(self):
    return f"{self.first} is {self.age}"

  @classmethod
  def display_active_users(cls):
    return f"There are currently {cls.active_users} active users"

  @property
  def full_name(self):
    return f"{self.first} {self.last}"

  @full_name.setter
  def full_name(self, name):
    self.first, self.last = name.split(' ')

  def birthday(self):
    self.age += 1
    return f"Happy {self.age}th, {self.first}"

  def logout(self):
    User.active_users -= 1
    return f"{self.first} has logged out"

class Moderator(User):
  def __init__(self, first, last, age, community):
    super().__init__(first, last, age)
    self.community = community

  def remove_post(self):
    return f"{self.full_name()} removed a post from the {self.community} community"

u1 = User('Tom', 'Garcia', 35)
print(u1._User__msg)
jasmine = Moderator('Jasmine', "O'conner", 61, 'Piano')
print(jasmine.remove_post())
print(User.display_active_users())
```

```js
class User {
  constructor(first, last, age) {
    this.first = first
    this.last = last
    this.age = age
  }

  get fullName() {
    return `${this.firstName} ${this.lastName}`
  }

  set fullName(fullName) {
    const names = fullName.split(' ')
    this.firstName = names[0]
    this.lastName = names[1]
  }

  static enrolledPerson() {
    return 'ENROLLING PERSONS!'
  }
}

class Cat extends Human {}

const jane = new Human('Foyez', 'Ahmed', 27)
console.log(Human.enrolledPerson())
```

## 4. Polymorphism
**Polymorphism:** A key principle in OOP is the idea of polymorphism - an object can take on many (poly) forms (morph).

**Example 1: The same class method works in a similar way for different classes**
```py
Cat.speak() # meow
Dog.speak() # woof
Human.speak() # yo
```

**Example 2: The operation works for different kinds of objects**
```py
sample_list = [1, 2, 3]
sample_tuple = (1, 2, 3)
sample_string = 'awesome'

len(sample_list)
len(sample_tuple)
len(sample_string)
```

## Polymorphism & Inheritance
**1. The same class method works in a similar waay for different classes**
A common implementation of this is to have a method in a base (or parent) class that is overriden by a subclass. This is called method **overridening**.

* Each subclass will have a different implementation of the method.
* If the method is not implemented in the subclass, the version in the parent class is called instead.

```py
class Animal():
  def speak(self):
    raise NotImplementedError('Subclass needs to implement this method')

class Dog(Animal):
  def speak(self):
    return 'woof'

class Cat(Animal):
  def speak(self):
    return 'meow'

class Fish(Animal):
  pass

d = Dog()
print(d.speak())

f = Fish()
print(f.speak())
```

**2. (Polymorphism) The same operation works for different kinds of objects**

```py
8 + 2 # 10
'8' + '2' # 82
```
